Image Compression Using K-Means Clustering 🎨🖼️
What is Image Compression?
Image compression reduces the file size of an image while keeping its quality as high as possible. K-Means clustering can help by reducing the number of unique colors in an image.

How K-Means Helps in Image Compression
🔹 An image is made up of thousands/millions of pixels, each having an RGB color.
🔹 Many colors in an image are very similar. Instead of storing all of them, we group similar colors together (using K-Means).
🔹 K-Means finds K dominant colors and replaces all pixels with their nearest dominant color.
🔹 This reduces the number of colors in the image, saving space while keeping it visually similar.
